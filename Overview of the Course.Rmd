**Week 1 | Predictive Modeling & Processes:**
1. The Data Science Process: Understanding the steps involved in the data science process, from problem definition to deployment.
2. Evaluating Models: Learning various metrics and techniques to evaluate the performance of predictive models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Week 2 | Data Exploration:**
1. Exploring Data Using Visualization: Utilizing graphical techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore and understand the underlying patterns and distributions in the data.
2. Missing Values: Handling missing values in the dataset through techniques such as deletion, imputation, or advanced methods like predictive modeling to fill in missing values.

**Week 3 | Linear Regression:**
1. Linear Regression: Understanding the concept of linear regression and its application in modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
2. Linear Regression Model Assumptions: Identifying and validating the key assumptions of the linear regression model, including linearity, independence of errors, constant variance, and normality of residuals.

**Week 4 | Classification:**
1. Logistic Regression: Learning about logistic regression, a classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.
2. Precision and Recall as Model Performance Measures: Understanding precision and recall as evaluation metrics for classification models, especially in scenarios where class imbalance exists.

**Week 5 | Generalized Linear Models:**
1. Introduction to GLMs: Exploring generalized linear models (GLMs), which extend linear regression to accommodate non-normally distributed response variables and non-linear relationships.
2. Advantages and Disadvantages of a GLM: Analyzing the strengths and limitations of GLMs, including their flexibility in modeling various types of data and their interpretability compared to more complex models.

**Week 6 | Tree Based Models:**
1. Decision Trees: Understanding decision trees as hierarchical structures that recursively partition the feature space based on the predictor variables to make predictions.
2. Random Forests: Exploring random forests as an ensemble learning method that aggregates multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting.

**Week 7 | Unsupervised Methods:**
1. K-Means Clustering: Learning about k-means clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition data into k distinct, non-overlapping clusters.
2. Cluster Analysis: Understanding cluster analysis as a method for grouping similar objects or data points into clusters based on their characteristics or attributes.

**Week 8 | Delivering Results:**
1. Importance of Documentation: Recognizing the significance of documentation in data science projects for reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration.
2. Git and GitHub: Learning about version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub for managing and sharing code, collaborating with team members, and tracking changes in projects.
